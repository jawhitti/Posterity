Old bits of code and whatnot.

###Serial.cpp###
Circa 1992 I was a budding C++ developer wanted to write a game that you could play remotely with your friends and of course to do that you needed a **modem**. Serial.cpp was my foray into that world using the Borland OWL framework. It performed basic RS232 communication with the modem. I did eventually write a little "tank" game that never worked very well all while managing to get bad grades in class.  Serial.cpp is how I met some of my friends though - I wandered down the hall and said "hey, do you have a modem?  Can I put this floppy into your computer and run it?"

I forgot all about this but recently I found it archived online at some random website.  At the moment this is the oldest bit of code of mine in my possession.  I wish I still had the code to COMSpy which I wrote in '99 while listening to Santana - Smooth.  If anyone has a copy I would appreciate it.
